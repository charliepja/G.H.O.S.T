# G.H.O.S.T

G.H.O.S.T is a discord bot built using the discod.js framework and Github's API module Octokit. The idea behind G.H.O.S.T is to allow teams to report, track, and update any issues without having to expose private github repos or codebases.


# Getting Started

To obtain a copy of this project on your local machine simply clone this repository with your preferred method. More details of this can be found [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/which-remote-url-should-i-use)

## Prerequisites

In order to run this project you will need to have the following software:

```

node v12.x.x

npm v6.x.x

Both can be obtained by downloading node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

```
To check what version of the software you are running, run `node -v` and `npm -v` in your chosen terminal.

## Installing

After installing node and npm, navigate to your project folder in your terminal.

To install all the npm modules run:

```
npm install

```

To create a `.env` file:

```
Create a new file at the root of your project directory called .env

Copy the keys from .env_example

```

## Deployment

First create a bot application at https://discord.com/developers/applications/

Click `New Application` and give your application a name of your choosing, then press `create`

That will take you to the general information page of your new application, on the left hand side press `Bot` then `Add Bot`

Here you can give your bot application a different username or a profile picture, however the important part is the `bot token`

Click `Copy` which is located under `Token` and paste that value into `TOKEN` that is located in the `.env` file. It is important that this is never shared with anyone.

Then on the left hand side click `OAuth2`, and under `scopes` check `bot` under `bot permissions` you can choose which permissions you require a bot to have in a guild for it to function. The minimum that Fox will require to work is `View Channels`, `Send Messages`, and `Read Message History`

Then under `scopes` copy the url and proceed to that url where you can select which guild you wish the bot to join. Press `continue` and then `Authorize`

The bot is now added to the guild, and the next thing to do is bring the bot online.

For the bot to stay on 24/7 it is recommended to use a VPS or a Dedicated Server, otherwise your local machine will need to stay on 24/7.

To bring the bot online on your local machine you can simply run the following command in your terminal `npm run bot` or use a process manager of your choice.
